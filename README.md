This web application is designed using HTML, CSS and Javascript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.
The app is designed in the folowing steps:
-Set up the general outline of the app using JavaScript.
-Set up a general dataset of the application and displayed it in very basic way to the user using JavaSript.
-Implemented a forEach loop to print details of each pokemon in the appÂ´s repository and updated forEach loops to work within the IIFE using JavaScript functions.
-Rendered static data from the data repository on the page and added basic styling to the app (DOM interaction).
Loaded data from external API via fetch using Ajax.
-Added multiple complex UI patterns to the app to show the pokemon details in modal.
-Used Bootstarp to create a clean and usable design for the app.
-Added ESLint rules and ensured the code passes the validation test.
