# Pokedex-app

This web application is designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

## The app is designed in the following steps:

-Built a general outline of the app using JavaScript. <br/>
-Built a general dataset of the application and displayed it in very basic way to the user using JavaSript.<br/>
-Implemented a forEach loop to print details of each Pokémon in the app´s repository and updated forEach loops to work within the IIFE using JavaScript functions.<br/>
-Rendered static data from the data repository on the page and added basic styling to the app (DOM interaction).<br/>
-Loaded data from external API via fetch using Ajax.<br/>
-Added multiple complex UI patterns to the app to show the pokemon details in modal.<br/>
-Used Bootstrapp to create a clean and usable design for the app.<br/>
-Added ESLint rules and ensured the code passes the validation test.<br/>
